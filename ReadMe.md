Am I Sam
======================
## A simple R Shiny app designed to help answer the increasingly important question of whether or not you are Sam.

> I 've spent countless nights lying in bed wondering/agonizing over whether or not a I was Sam. Such an important question but how could I know, how could any of us now. Luckily now there's an answer "Am I Sam" is an application built to help you and I and eveyone else know if we are Sam. With Am I Sam I was finally able to figure out if I was Sam or not. Unfortunately I'm not Sam, but at least now I know.
